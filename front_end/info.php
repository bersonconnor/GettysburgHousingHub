      <h2>RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION</h2><br>
      <p> At the heart of the mission of Gettysburg College is the fact that we are a residential campus. Gettysburg offers a wide variety of housing options that are designed to be highly supportive and interactive in the first two years and move toward independent living in the last two years. We are committed to developing a caring community that encourages academic success, champions individual respect, and demands responsibility within our community. In order to achieve these community ideals, we expect all residents to work together to create a positive living environment.</p>
